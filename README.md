# model_and_simulation
Modeling and Simulation Final Project

## Part 1:
* Modeling demand based on key factors (NOT affecting supply)
* Modeling each factors stochastically

#### Checkpoint 1:#
* Gather all possible factors for our model from research
* Reduce using PCA and logic by analyzing correlation with the target factor (demand or price)
* Extension: Start modeling demand using the factors we selected by running simulations.

#### Checkpoint 2: 
* Combine all key factors and verify our model with data

## Part 2:
* Modeling supply based on key factors (NOT affecting demand)
* Modeling each factors stochastically

## Part 3:
* Modeling demand and supply together
* Run simulations to predict demand and price

## Part 4:
* Modeling the market
* Run simulations to predict demand and price
